The Attendance Management System is a robust web application I developed using a combination of Java technologies and web development tools. This system leverages Java Networking, Java Swing, Java Regex, Java AWT, and SQL, along with HTML and CSS for the frontend. Built with Derby as the database and NetBeans as the IDE, the application allows for comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It efficiently manages student records by enabling additions, removals, and tracking attendance.
